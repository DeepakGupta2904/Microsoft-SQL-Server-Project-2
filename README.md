# Microsoft-SQL-Server-Project-2
Project: Relational Database Design.
I am done this project at Intellipaat Solution Pvt. Ltd. as an Trainee.

In this project, I worked on converting a relational design that lists various users, their roles, user accounts, and their statuses into different tables in SQL Server and inserts data into them. Ensuring at least two rows in each table, I made sure to create the respective foreign keys.

Tasks To Be Performed:
● Define relations/attributes
● Define primary keys
● Create foreign keys
